Decaf Language Compiler
------------------------

Current Status: Parser Generator (Phase - 1 Checkpoint) is completed in principle.

Possible options for extension:

1. Extending the Parser to comply with the full Decaf standard. Thereafter implement the full standard instead of the reduced standard as per project specification provided.
2. Extension to a JIT and thus, an REPL environment for Decaf.
3. Addition of Optimization passes.
